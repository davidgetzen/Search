'''Khunjerab Pass''' (elevation {{convert|4693|m|ft|disp=or}}) is a high [[mountain pass]] in the [[Karakoram Mountains]] in a [[strategic]] position on the northern border of [[Pakistan|Pakistan's]] [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] region within the region of [[Kashmir]] and on the southwest border of the [[Xinjiang]] region of [[People's Republic of China|China]].  Its name is derived from [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]] for ''Blood Valley''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Sino-Pakistani Border Crossing==
The Khunjerab Pass is the highest paved international border crossing in the world and the highest point on the [[Karakoram Highway]].  The [[roadway]] across the pass was completed in 1982, and has superseded the unpaved [[Mintaka Pass|Mintaka]] and [[Kilik Pass|Kilik]] Passes as the primary passage across the Karakoram Range.

On the Pakistani side, the pass is {{convert|42|km|abbr=on}} from the National Park station and checkpoint in Dih, {{convert|75|km|abbr=on}} from the customs and immigration post in [[Sost]], {{convert|270|km|abbr=on}} from [[Gilgit]], and {{convert|870|km|abbr=on}} from [[Islamabad]].

On the Chinese side, the pass is {{convert|130|km|abbr=on}} from [[Tashkurgan Town|Tashkurgan]], {{convert|420|km|abbr=on}} from [[Kashgar]] and some {{convert|1890|km|abbr=on}} from [[Urumqi]].  The Chinese port of entry is located {{convert|3.5|km|abbr=on}} along the road from the pass in [[Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County|Tashkurgan County]].

The long, relatively flat pass is often snow-covered during the winter season and as a consequence is generally closed from November 30 to May 1.  There is excellent grazing on the Chinese side of the pass, and domesticated [[yaks]] and ''[[Dzo|dzu]]'' (a cross between yaks and cows) may be seen from the road.

Since June 1, 2006, there has been a daily bus service across the boundary from [[Gilgit]], to [[Kashghar]], [[People's Republic of China|China]]&lt;ref&gt;Road widening work has begun on {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} of the highway. [http://www.dawn.com/2006/03/23/nat2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, consultants &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/IB24Df02.html ''Online Asia Times''  South Asia Feb 24, 2007.  "China-Pakistan rail link on horizon." Syed Fazl-e-Haider.]&lt;/ref&gt; were engaged to investigate the construction of a railway through this pass to connect [[Transport in the People's Republic of China|China]] with transport in Pakistani-administered northern areas of [[Kashmir]]. A feasibility study started in November 2009 for a line connecting [[Havelian]] 750&amp;nbsp;km (466&amp;nbsp;mi) away in Pakistan and [[Kashgar]] 350&amp;nbsp;km (217&amp;nbsp;mi) in China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CH/13/Kashi.html&lt;/ref&gt;
